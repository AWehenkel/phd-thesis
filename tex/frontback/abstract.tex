\chapter*{Abstract}
One of the most notable distinctions between humans and other animals is our ability to grow collective intelligence along generations. This development appears exponential; we are witnessing an explosion of knowledge and technical capabilities. Artificial intelligence enables human-made objects to participate in this collective intelligence and to push its boundaries. In particular, machine learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence that studies the creation of intelligence by computers. With the rapid progress of information technology and the profusion of data, machine learning is becoming crucial in collective intelligence growth.

By allowing the representation of randomness and uncertainty inherent to the world around us, probabilistic models are at the root of this revolution of intelligence. In this context, this thesis presents various contributions to the development of modern approaches to probabilistic modelling between $2018$ to $2022$. 

2) The role of deep learning is predominant in artificial intelligence.

2) The goal and contribution of the thesis.

3) Why development in uninformed is important.

4) Why develoment in informed is important.
