A word from the artist: \\
\textit{This piece was created in collaboration with artificial intelligence, taking an original human-made artwork and reimagining it with VQGAN-CLIP, a text-to-image AI network. The end result mixes 1960s Brutalist architecture and 18th-century botanical illustration to unique effect.}
