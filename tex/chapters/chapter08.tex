\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:08}
At first glance, the way nature drives the world around us appears chaotic. Still, some perspectives reveal patterns in this illusive disorder. The ability to discover and exploit these structures is Intelligence. Encoding these structures into mathematical objects called models eventually reduces intelligent reasoning to a list of computing operations and gives rise to artificial intelligence. This dissertation has studied techniques for automated model discovery -- artificial intelligence that produces intelligence -- machine learning. In particular, we have argued for a probabilistic approach to modelling that naturally benefits from modern computers, data, and existing knowledge.


%  is the field of science that study the intelligence of human-made objects' behaviour. Intelligent systems are the ones that produce responses that inherits from the structure we perceive as humans. This thesis stands for a probabilistic approach to modelling. Our aim was to prove the effectiveness

% \section{Summary}
% - Uninformed vs informed models
% - Combining models is nice.
% - All the advice we should remember flows.
%   1) Do not use to many steps without a good reasons, it does not help expressivity.
%   2) If possible use expressive 1D transformation such as monotonic ones.
%   3) But also bias the learning toward reasonable models - embed as much domain knowledge as you can.
